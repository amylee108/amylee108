# Amy Lee - Projects
---------------------
### Hello! My name is Amy Lee, and I am a 2022 Master of Science in Business Analytics candidate at the University of Georgia (UGA).
#### This is a place where I will be showcasing the application of what I have learned in classroom settings to real solutions companies, corporations, and individuals may face related to data science. As I learn more techniques, my portfolio of projects will continue to grow.

### Project - Automate Excel (September 2021)
#### Doing mundane, repetitive tasks through Excel could be time-consuming, wasteful of resources, and can allow for more error. By automating the creating of pivot tables through Python code, we are able to automate the process required to manually discipher and analyze data. To view resulting pivot table and data, please download 'reported.xlsx'.

Language: Python

### Project - Web Scraping Using R (September 2021)
##### Manually inputting data is time-consuming and could allow for more human error. In this project, I scraped titles, prices, availability, and images of books on a book website, created a dataframe from the information collected, and presented it in a clean table. 

Language: R

### Project - Generating Tableau Reports (October 2021)

#### Visualization data through Tableau can be a powerful tool in conveying various trends, messages, and patterns in the data. This project was based on New York City Property sales and shows various aspects of NYC property sales history, such as aggreagate sales by year, valuation of different types of buildings, and more.
